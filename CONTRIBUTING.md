# 💁‍♂️ Contributing to LUKSO Playground

We're thrilled you're interested in contributing to the LUKSO Playground! This space is dedicated to providing developers with code snippets and tools for interacting with LUKSO standards efficiently.

## Getting Started

1. Create a fork of this repository.
2. Clone your repository to make changes.
3. Follow the installation within the [README.md](./README.md)

## Making Changes

1. **Create a separate branch**: For each new feature, docs, or fix, create a new branch in your fork like the following structure: `feature/feature-name` or `fix/issue-fix`, `docs/added-content`. The naming helps organize your contributions and separates them from your main branch.
2. **Commit your changes**: After running `npm run build` and applying styles using `prettier`, you can commit your local changes to your branch. Please ensure that changes are regularly pulled from the `main` branch of the original repository to stay up-to-date and avoid conflicts.
3. **Submit a pull request**: Once your changes are ready and tested, you can push the latest changes to your GitHub fork and `submit a pull request` to this repository. Please provide a clear and detailed explanation of the changes and why they are needed. Include any relevant `issue numbers`.
4. **Review Process**: The project maintainers will review your pull request. Be open to feedback and be prepared to make further changes if requested. Once approved, a maintainer will `merge` your changes into the `main` branch.

## Contribution Guidelines

To ensure a smooth contribution process for everyone, please follow these guidelines:

- **Maintain Generality**: This repository is designed as a generic foundation for developers to start building with LSPs efficiently. Contributions should not introduce features too specific or outside of the LSP ecosystem.
- **Follow Code Styles**: Follow the coding conventions used throughout the project, including indentation, naming conventions, and comments.
- **Build and Test**: Ensure your code does not break the existing functionality. Add tests for any new features or fixes when possible. Any upcoming features should not break existing scripts or contracts.
- **Create Documentation**: Add or update any relevant documentation with your changes, especially if adding new features.

## Report Bugs

If you've found issues within contracts or scripts, please [open a new issue](https://github.com/lukso-network/lukso-playground/issues).
